# Uraniborg

Uraniborg is a public observatory/repository that collects and hosts information
about pre-installed apps. Users can use tools in this repository to get a
"snapshot" on the state of installed devices. When used on a new device prior to
or skipping accounts set-up, the state of pre-isntalled packages on the device
can be obtained.

This repository currently contains code that can be used to build an explorer
app (APK) called Hubble.

The name of this project and its components are mainly inspired by the field of
astronomy.

- [Uraniborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uraniborg) is a Danish
astronomical observatory.
- [Hubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) is a space telescope used for astronomy observations.
